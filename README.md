# Shin, Zen, Bi

Truth, Zen, and Beauty. A Kyudo approach to software and personal development.

As a Japanese archery practitioner and Front End Developer, I find a lot of shared core principles between the two.

Often, achieving the best outcome means respecting your audience, be true to yourself, practice, learn from your mistakes, be mindful, and doing all this in a beautiful way. 

The talk will give a brief intro/demonstration of Kyudo, then highlight how we can adapt it to IT practices and personal development.

This 45mins talk was prepared for:
